# Project-Euler-solutions

A repository of the solutions I came up with for Project Euler problems (https://projecteuler.net/).

Some are in CPP, some are in Python. Originally, I used PE as a way to learn CPP. For problems that were harder, I usually tried to create a solution in Python before moving to CPP.

I will try to organize this repository soon.
